      <h2>Twitter Header</h2>
      <p>
        This was the first thing I worked on after practicing in Photoshop. It's
        a simple header I made just for myself using assets from the popular
        indie game Hollow Knight as it was what I was playing at the time.

      <h2>Indesign Resumes</h2>
      <p>
        While studying graphic design we were tasked with making personalized
        resumes! Mixing Indesign and Photoshop I came up with two seperate
        options for my resume, one being more professional and the other being a
        bit cuter but definitely a niche resume. Lots of things I would change design wise today but still fun to look back on.

      <h2>This Website</h2>
      <p>
       Most recent thing I've worked on is this website! Using html and css I was tasked with creating a personal website showcasing what I've learned so far in class! Very fun project and I'm looking forward to continuing to improve on this foundation in the future!
